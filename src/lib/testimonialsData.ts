AIUB is not just a SB, its a process that takes an average student and shape them into a responsible citizen by creating interest for both engineering and community development. I have always been a fan, follower and a supporter to AIUB and I feel really honored when I happen to get chance to assist or guide them with any IEEE related decision. Wish AIUB and its amazing people all the very best for their personal and mutual endeavors.",
